                            failure or over temperature. The system is connected to a total of 13 sensors of which 11 are temperature
                            sensors placed in critical locations. Two sensors are connected to the pumps so they can monitor their operation.
                            The system is so complex that every minute of the electronics performs readings from the sensor and the results are sent to the server where they are stored in the base.</p>
